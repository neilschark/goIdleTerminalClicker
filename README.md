# goIdleTerminalClicker

A terminal idle clicker I build to learn the basics of go.

This is bad code. I simply looked at a single thing in go (e.g. structs, slices, etc) and build a simple function to test how this concept worked. That's all. So don't use anything you find here. Please just don't. ;)

How to play:

Start the program and select the factory you want to upgrade, that's it.
